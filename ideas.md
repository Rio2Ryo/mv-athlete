  **Design Movement**: **Eco-Futurism / Solarpunk**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Symbiosis of Nature & Tech**: Visuals should seamlessly blend organic elements (leaves, earth textures) with high-tech interfaces (data overlays, neon accents).
  2. **Vitality & Energy**: The design must pulse with life, using motion and light to represent the "24-hour generation" and "energy" concepts.
  3. **Transparency & Depth**: Use glassmorphism and layering to suggest depth, representing the deep history (3.5 billion years) and the transparent nature of the foundation.
  4. **Athlete-Centric Focus**: Every element should guide the user towards empowerment and action.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Deep Space Black (#050505)**: Represents the universe and the void from which life emerged.
  - **Bioluminescent Green (#39FF14)**: Represents the Mother Vegetable's life force and energy. Used for primary actions and key highlights.
  - **Earth Blue (#0077BE)**: Represents the planet and water, used for secondary elements.
  - **Clean White (#FFFFFF)**: For high-contrast typography to ensure readability against dark backgrounds.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Asymmetric & Fluid**: Avoid rigid grids. Use flowing lines and organic shapes to guide the eye down the page.
  - **Section Overlaps**: Sections should bleed into each other, creating a continuous narrative rather than distinct blocks.
  - **Floating Elements**: Key information cards should appear to float in 3D space.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Glowing Orbs/Particles**: Subtle background animations of floating particles to represent nutrients and energy.
  - **Neon Borders**: Thin, glowing lines to frame important content.
  - **Glass Cards**: Semi-transparent backgrounds for text blocks to maintain visibility of the background imagery.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Scroll-Triggered Reveals**: Content should fade in and slide up as the user scrolls, mimicking growth.
  - **Hover Glows**: Interactive elements should emit a soft glow when hovered.
  - **Parallax Depth**: Background layers move at different speeds to create immersion.

  **Animation**:
  - **Continuous Rotation**: The Earth in the hero section should slowly rotate.
  - **Pulse Effects**: Buttons and key highlights should have a gentle, rhythmic pulse.
  - **Smooth Transitions**: Page transitions should be fluid, like water.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: **Orbitron** or **Rajdhani** (Tech/Futuristic sans-serif) for a modern, scientific feel.
  - **Body**: **Exo 2** or **Barlow** (Clean, geometric sans-serif) for high readability.
  - **Accents**: **Share Tech Mono** for data points and technical details.

  **Design Movement**: **Dark Brutalism / High-Performance**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Raw Power**: Emphasize strength and durability through bold, heavy typography and high-contrast imagery.
  2. **Unapologetic Boldness**: Large text, massive images, and stark contrasts to command attention.
  3. **Structural Integrity**: Visible grids and lines to suggest stability and engineering precision (referencing the factories).
  4. **Direct & Impactful**: Minimal decoration, maximum impact. Focus on the core message.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Matte Black (#111111)**: A solid, grounding base.
  - **Neon Lime (#CCFF00)**: A high-visibility sports color for urgent calls to action.
  - **Concrete Grey (#333333)**: For structural elements and secondary text.
  - **Signal White (#F0F0F0)**: For primary messaging.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Modular / Block-Based**: Content is organized into distinct, heavy blocks.
  - **Oversized Typography**: Headlines take up significant screen real estate.
  - **Split Screens**: Contrast athlete imagery with technical data side-by-side.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Thick Dividers**: Heavy lines separating sections.
  - **Monochrome Imagery**: Black and white photos with neon overlays.
  - **Big Numbers**: Stat-heavy design highlighting the "700x" and "48 nutrients".

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Hard Cuts**: Instant transitions, no fading.
  - **Sticky Headers**: Navigation stays locked in place.
  - **Cursor Effects**: Custom cursor that inverts colors or expands on hover.

  **Animation**:
  - **Marquee Text**: Scrolling text banners for announcements.
  - **Glitch Effects**: Subtle tech glitches on hover.
  - **Staggered Reveals**: Elements slam into place.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: **Tusker Grotesk** or **Anton** (Tall, bold sans-serif).
  - **Body**: **Roboto Mono** or **Space Mono** (Monospaced for technical feel).

  **Design Movement**: **Organic Minimalism / Zen Tech**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Harmony & Balance**: Focus on the balance between nature (Mother Vegetable) and human potential (Athletes).
  2. **Breathability**: Extensive whitespace (or "darkspace") to allow content to breathe.
  3. **Softness & Flow**: Rounded corners, soft shadows, and gentle gradients.
  4. **Clarity & Focus**: Remove all non-essential elements to focus on the core benefits.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Deep Forest Green (#0A2F1F)**: A rich, natural background color.
  - **Soft Sage (#8FBC8F)**: For accents and secondary buttons.
  - **Warm Gold (#D4AF37)**: To represent the "MVP Coin" and value.
  - **Cream (#F5F5DC)**: For text, softer than pure white.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Central Axis**: Content flows down a central spine, branching out like a leaf.
  - **Card-Based**: Information is contained in soft, rounded cards.
  - **Whitespace Dominance**: Large margins and padding.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Leaf Motifs**: Subtle leaf shapes used as background patterns or masks.
  - **Soft Gradients**: Backgrounds that shift gently between shades of green.
  - **Circular Imagery**: Profile pictures and key visuals in circles.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Gentle Fades**: Everything transitions smoothly.
  - **Scroll Parallax**: Subtle movement of background elements.
  - **Micro-Interactions**: Small, delightful animations on buttons.

  **Animation**:
  - **Floating**: Elements gently bob up and down.
  - **Fade & Scale**: Content fades in and slightly scales up.
  - **Ripple Effects**: Button clicks create a ripple.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: **Playfair Display** or **Spectral** (Elegant serif) for a touch of class.
  - **Body**: **Lato** or **Nunito** (Rounded sans-serif) for approachability.
